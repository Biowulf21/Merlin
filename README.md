### Customizing the Email Body
Customizing the email body by using information on the Merlin Google Sheet file is very easy. As of the moment, Merlin customizes the __NAME__, __DATE__, and __LINK__ columns from the Google sheet.
1. Every instance of the words above (__NAME__, __DATE__, __LINK__) will be replaced by the respective information from the Google Sheet file.
1. You can customize these words by changing these codeblocks:

## FAQ
1. __Q: How many emails can Merlin send bulk emails to?__  
__A:__ Merlin can send as many emails as needed as long as all information from the Google Sheet file is correct. Do keep in mind that Google API calls (Google Drive and Google Sheets) are limited and may cause errors if too many emails are being sent emails at once.
