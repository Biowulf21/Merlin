Hi NAME!

There has been an emergency raised by our photography studio regarding the level 3 quarantine status in CDO. In accordance with the level 3 quarantine status, we are to reschedule pictorial reservations per course. In a day, we can only cater 40 subscribers for the pictorials and your selected date has more than the aforementioned limit. 

These are the days we are offering for rescheduling:
February 7, 8, 9, 10, and 11. 

Note: If you have already been contacted please disregard this email, your multiple reschedule attempts has been included.

This is a great opportunity to reschedule, since the penalties discussed in the subscription manual will not be counted.  With that in mind, our website seems to be faulty at the moment and we cannot retrieve the phone number you have provided upon your subscription to this year's Yearbook. We would like you to answer this very brief form so that we can contact you via cellular method to discuss your availability for reschedule since we will be manually rescheduling your account so that we can track which accounts to remove the penalties involved when rescheduling.
